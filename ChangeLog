	Worked around the problem that gdb reports "Using host libthread_db"
	on Fedora Core when it processes the file command.

Version 1.9.3

	Improved editing of values; it is now possible to edit variables also
	in the watch window.

Version 1.9.2

	The previous security fix only protects against accidents, not attacks,
	as Matt Zimmerman pointed out. Did it right this time.

	Basic editing of values in the local variables window is available.
	More refinements are still necessary.

	Fixed security flaw regarding the program specific debugger command.

	Configurable key bindings.

	Improved register formating by Daniel Kristjansson.

	"Orphaned breakpoints", i.e. breakpoints that gdb cannot set
	immediately, can be set. This helps debug shared libraries and
	dynamically loaded modules.

Version 1.2.10

	Fixed the "Using host libthread_db" error message.

Version 1.2.9

	The previous security fix only protects against accidents, not attacks,

	Fixed security flaw regarding the program specific debugger command.

Version 1.2.7

	Fixed parsing of stack frames for recent gdbs.

	When a pointer to a struct is expanded the struct is also expanded.

	Improved toolbar and application icons.

Version 1.2.5

	Now compiles for KDE 3.

Version 1.2.4

	Now compiles for KDE 3 (Beta1).

	Support QString of Qt 3.x.

	Improved (and fixed) the display of arrays with repeated values.

	Fixed crash when a file is reloaded while disassembled code is
	displayed.

	Fixed parsing of stack frames involving signal handler invocations.

Version 1.2.3

	Fixed invisible toolbar under KDE 2.x (really, this time, I promise).

	Fixed crash when no line has the cursor (empty files).

	Don't display a blank page when a non-existing file was tried to open.

Version 1.2.2

	Fixed a special, but common case where removing a breakpoint didn't
	work but add more on the same line instead (thanks to Ron Lerech).

	Fixed invisible toolbar under KDE 2.1.2 (thanks to Neil Butterworth).

	Fixed compilation for gcc 3.0 (thanks to Ben Burton):

	Fixed make install if srcdir != builddir.

	Changed encoding of German translations (and also Danish, Italian,

	variables window to the watch window.

	The working directory for the program being debugged can be set
	(Execution|Arguments).

	There's now  a global options dialog in place (File|Global Options).
	At the moment the debugger program (which must be gdb, but it could be
	an experimental gdb version, for example) and the terminal for program
	output can be specified.

	Fixed Makefiles to support make DESTDIR=/tmp/foo install (which is
	needed by packagers and to create relocatable RPMs).

	There's now a Danish translation thanks to
	Steen Rabol <rabol@get2net.dk>.

Version 0.3.0

Starting with this version, Qt 1.42 and KDE 1.1 is required.

	Ported to Qt 2.0 and KDE post-1.1! KDbg now runs with both
	KDE 1.1 (using Qt 1.42) and the latest experimental KDE. You can of
	course run one version and debug programs written for the other version.

	KDbg can now display Qt 2.0's QString values (which are Unicode
	strings)!

	Environment variables can be set. Changes become effective the next time
	the program being debugged is run.

	The breakpoint list has been improved. It disables command buttons at
	times when it is not possible to change breakpoints. The icons that
	show the breakpoint status are now the same as those in the source
	window.

	Popup menus (context menus) for frequently used commands have been added
	to the source code window (thanks to Tom Nguyen <ttomnguyen@yahoo.com>)

	There's now a Russian translation thanks to
	Ilmar Habibulin <ilmar@ints.ru>.

	Internal restructuring. These changes are invisible. They just make
	future extensions less cumbersome.

Version 0.2.5

This is the last version that supports Qt 1.33 and KDE 1.0.

	There's now a Czech translation thanks to
	Martin Spirk <spirk@kla.pvt.cz>.

	Recognize and report when gdb dies unexpectedly. This happens commonly
	when writing CORBA programs since gdb obviously has problems in
	debugging C++ classes with virtual base classes.

	Added conditional breakpoints and ignore counts.

Version 0.2.4

	Added a toolbar button to load the executable. The button to open a
	source file is still there. I hope it's clear which one does what.

	Attaching to a running process is now possible (Execution|Attach).

	Made more visible when gdb is busy using a gear wheel in the upper right
	corner of the window like kfm.

	Made the KTreeView widget more flexible by adding a bunch of virtual
	keywords. (No, this doesn't have any influence on the look and feel of
	KDbg.) While doing that, I fixed a small repainting bug.
