This is KDbg, a graphical user interface around gdb using
KDE, the K Desktop Environment.

To install:

	./configure
	make
	make install


I've heard reports that kdbg sends debugging messages to a message box by
default. This is annoying.  To send the debugging output to stderr, create
a file .kde/share/config/kdbgrc with the following contents:

----- cut here
# KDE Config File
[KDebug]
FatalShow=
ErrorOutput=2
WarnFilename=kdebug.dbg
InfoShow=
FatalFilename=kdebug.dbg
WarnOutput=2
InfoOutput=2
FatalOutput=2
ErrorFilename=kdebug.dbg
InfoFilename=kdebug.dbg
AbortFatal=0
WarnShow=
ErrorShow=
----- cut here

You can change this from within KDbg using Ctrl-Shift-F12, which pops up a huge
dialog box where you can select where debugging output should go.

Problem reports as well as success stories are welcome!
