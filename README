This is KDbg, a graphical user interface around gdb using
KDE, the K Desktop Environment.

To install:

	./configure --prefix=/opt/kde3
	make
	make install

Choose the location of your KDE3 installation as prefix. In particular,
do not choose /usr/local unless you have KDE3 installed there or you know
what you are doing.

Problem reports as well as success stories are welcome!

The homepage is at

You'll find the most recent version of KDbg there as well as
other useful information concerning debugging.
