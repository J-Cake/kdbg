Introduction</H2>
KDbg is a front-end for <TT>gdb</TT>, the GNU debugger.

<P>At the moment there is not much documentation available.

<P>For the really brave there's documentation about how <A HREF="types.html">KDbg
can understand types</A> like <TT>QString</TT>.
<H2>
What's it that I see here?</H2>
The main window of KDbg consist of four panes:

<P>The <B>upper left</B> pane shows the source code. Mostly, source code
windows are opened automatically. To open a souce code window manually
choose <I>File|Open Source</I> from the menu. You can switch the opened
source code windows by choosing an open source file from the <I>Window</I>
menu.

<P>The <B>lower left</B> pane displays the backtrace (aka stack frames),
i.e. the functions that the program has entered, but not left yet. The
innermost frame (where the program currently executes) is shown at the
top. Double-click on a stack frame to inspect the variables of that frame.

<P>The <B>upper right</B> pane displays the local variables. Whenever the
progam stops, KDbg displays the values of the local variables in this pane.

<P>The <B>lower right</B> pane displays expressions of your choice (such
expression is also called a <I>watch</I>). To add an expression, type it
into the edit field and press Enter or click <I>Add</I>. To remove an expression,
click on it (choose the root of the expression) and click <I>Del</I>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Using KDbg</H2>
To <B>debug a program</B>, choose <I>File|Executable</I> from the menu.
The program is loaded. An <TT>xterm</TT> window is opened which will show
the output of the debuggee. If you want to debug a <B>core dump</B>, you
must first load the executable that produced the core dump, then choose
<I>File|Core Dump</I> from the menu. Now KDbg goes to the point in the
program that caused the core dump.

<P>To run the <B>program with arguments</B>, choose <I>Execution|Arguments</I>
and type in the arguments. Next time the program is started, the arguments
will be passed on.

<P>In the menu <I>Execution</I> you find the commands that you need to
<B>run</B> the program, <B>step</B> through code, and to <B>interrupt</B>
the program (<I>Break</I>) while it is running. The important commands
(<I>Run</I> and all kinds of <I>Step</I>) are bound to function keys. For
efficient debugging I strongly recommend that you get used to using them.
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>The functions are not configurable, but perhaps you want
to contribute a bit of code that does it?</FONT>

<P>In the menu <I>Breakpoint</I> you find commands to set, clear, disable,
and enable permanent and temporary <B>breakpoints</B>. You can display
a list of active breakpoints.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
The breakpoint list</H3>
The breakpoint list can be displayed using <I>Breakpoint|List</I>. The
breakpoint location is shown for each breakpoint. A red icon in front of
the entry indicates that the breakpoint is disabled, a green icon indicates
an enabled breakpoint.

<P>Tip: You can use breakpoints as bookmarks: Just set a breakpoint and
disable it. Later, you can quickly come back to that breakpoint by double-clicking
it in the breakpoint list (or select it and click <I>View Code</I>). Since
breakpoints are persistent (i.e. KDbg remembers them across invocations
of a program), you get them back next time you invoke KDbg for that particular
program.
