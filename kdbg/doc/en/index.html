<A NAME="Introduction"></A>Introduction</H2>
KDbg is a front-end for <TT>gdb</TT>, the GNU debugger.

<P>At the moment there is not much documentation available.

<P>For the really brave there's documentation about how <A HREF="types.html">KDbg
can understand types</A> like <TT>QString</TT>.
<H2>
<A NAME="WhatsThis"></A>What's it that I see here?</H2>
The main window of KDbg consist of four panes:

<P>The <B>upper left</B> pane shows the source code. Mostly, source code
windows are opened automatically. To open a souce code window manually
choose <I>File|Open Source</I> from the menu. You can switch the opened
source code windows by choosing an open source file from the <I>Window</I>
menu.

<P>The <B>lower left</B> pane displays the backtrace (aka stack frames),
i.e. the functions that the program has entered, but not left yet. The
innermost frame (where the program currently executes) is shown at the
top. Double-click on a stack frame to inspect the variables of that frame.

<P>The <B>upper right</B> pane displays the local variables. Whenever the
progam stops, KDbg displays the values of the local variables in this pane.

<P>The <B>lower right</B> pane displays expressions of your choice (such
expression is also called a <I>watch</I>). To add an expression, type it
into the edit field and press Enter or click <I>Add</I>. To remove an expression,
click on it (choose the root of the expression) and click <I>Del</I>.

<P>The gearwheel in the toolbar indicates whether gdb is working, in which
case it rotates. It rotates fast while KDbg wouldn't accept execution commands,
and it rotates slowly while KDbg gets the variable values.
<H2>
<A NAME="UsingKDbg"></A>Using KDbg</H2>
To <B>debug a program</B>, choose <I>File|Executable</I> from the menu.
The program is loaded. An <TT>xterm</TT> window is opened which will show
the output of the debuggee. If you want to debug a <B>core dump</B>, you
must first load the executable that produced the core dump, then choose
<I>File|Core Dump</I> from the menu. Now KDbg goes to the point in the
program that caused the core dump.

<P>To run the <B>program with arguments</B>, choose <I>Execution|Arguments</I>
and type in the arguments. Next time the program is started, the arguments
will be passed on.

<P>To set <B>environment variabels</B> for the program, choose <I>Execution|Arguments</I>.
In the environment variables section type in an expression of the form
<TT>VARIABLE=value</TT> to set the environment variable <TT>VARIABLE</TT>
to the value <TT>value, and</TT> click <I>Modify</I>. To remove a variable,
select it from the list below and click <I>Remove</I>. To change the value,
edit the value in the edit field and click <I>Modify</I>. If you change
the name of the variable and click <I>Modify</I>, you add a new variable!

<P>In the menu <I>Execution</I> you find the commands that you need to
<B>run</B> the program, <B>step</B> through code, and to <B>interrupt</B>
the program (<I>Break</I>) while it is running. The important commands
(<I>Run</I> and all kinds of <I>Step</I>) are bound to function keys. For
efficient debugging I strongly recommend that you get used to using them.
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>The functions are not configurable, but perhaps you want
to contribute a bit of code that does it?</FONT>

<P>In the menu <I>Breakpoint</I> you find commands to set, clear, disable,
and enable permanent and temporary <B>breakpoints</B>. You can display
a list of active breakpoints. You can also set a breakpoint by clicking
at the left end of the source line (using the left mouse button), and you
can enable and disable a breakpoint by clicking it using the middle mouse
button.
<H3>
The breakpoint list</H3>
The breakpoint list can be displayed using <I>Breakpoint|List</I>. For
each breakpoint the following is shown: the breakpoint location, the hit
count, the ignore count if set, the condition if set. The icon in front
of the entry indicates whether the breakpoint is enabled (a full red dot)
or disabled (a hollow circle), whether the breakpoint is temporary (a tiny
clock is overlaid) or whether the breakpoint is conditional (a tiny question
mark is overlaid).

<P>You can set a <B>condition</B> on a breakpoint (so that the program
is only stopped if the condition is true) or set an <B>ignore count</B>
(so that the program is not stopped the next n times that the breakpoint
is hit). To do that, press the <I>Conditional</I> button and enter the
condition and/or ignore count.

You can use breakpoints as bookmarks: Just set a breakpoint and disable
it. Later, you can quickly come back to that breakpoint by double-clicking
it in the breakpoint list (or select it and click <I>View Code</I>). Since
breakpoints are persistent (i.e. KDbg remembers them across invocations
of a program), you get them back next time you invoke KDbg for that particular
program.</LI>

<LI>
You can change a program variable's value: In the variable watch section
(in the lower right) type an assignment like this: <TT>var.member=17</TT>
and click <I>Add</I>. This immediately changes the value of the variable.
You should delete the expression from the list right away (by selecting
it in the window below and clicking <I>Del</I>). This is because the watch
expressions are evaluate each time the program stops, and by this the variable
would be changed to the specified value again and again!</LI>

<LI>
You can display a value in the watch section in different way by prepending
gdb's format specifiers in front of the variable to display. E.g. <TT>/x
var.member</TT> displays the <TT>var.member</TT> in hexadecimal notation.</LI>

<A NAME="KnownProblems"></A>Known problems</H2>
gdb 4.16 has problems in handling C++ classes with virtual base classes.
(Such classes commonly occur in CORBA programs.) It dies quite often due
to a segmentation violation. KDbg reports when gdb exits unexpectedly.
Unfortunately, you cannot really do anything about it. You have to restart
gdb by choosing <I>File|Executable</I>, which restarts your debugging session
:-(.

<P>KDbg's type recognition only works for libraries that are linked dynamically
to the program being debugged.
