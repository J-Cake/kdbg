<h2>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
KDbg is a front-end for <tt>gdb</tt>, the GNU debugger.
<p>This means that KDbg itself is not the debugger. Rather, it communicates
with <tt>gdb</tt>, a command line debugger, by sending commands to it and
receiving the output, such as variable values. The menu commands and mouse
clicks are translated into <tt>gdb</tt> commands, and the output of <tt>gdb</tt>
is translated into (more or less) visible information, such as structured
variable contents.
<p>The upshot of all this is that KDbg completely relies on the capabilities
of the underlying command line debugger, <tt>gdb</tt>. KDbg can do no more
than <tt>gdb</tt> can. For example, if you have a <tt>gdb</tt> that does
not supports debugging of threaded programs, KDbg cannot, either (even
though it offers a threads window).
<h2>
<a NAME="UsingKDbg"></a>Using KDbg</h2>
Before you start using KDbg, you may want to review the options in the
<a href="globaloptions.html">Global Options</a> dialog that you invoke
with <i>File|Global Options</i>.
<h4>
Specifying a debugging target</h4>
To debug a program, choose <i>File|Executable</i> from the menu. If you
have debugged the program earlier, you can choose it from <i>File|Recent
Executables</i>. The program is loaded.
<p>If you want to debug a core dump, you must first load the executable
that produced the core dump, then choose
<i>File|Core Dump</i> from the
menu. Now KDbg goes to the point in the program that caused the core dump.
<p>You can now set breakpoints, using the <i>Breakpoint</i> menu, the right
mouse button menu, or the <a href="breakptlist.html">breakpoint window</a>.
<p>You can also choose program specific settings that apply only to the
currently loaded executable using <i>File|Settings</i>, in the <a href="pgmsettings.html">Program
Settings</a> dialog.
<h4>
Running the program</h4>
Now run the program by selecting <i>Execution|Run</i>. The program now
executes as usual until it either exits, hits a breakpoint or watchpoint,
or receives a signal.
<p>You can run the program with arguments, set a working directory, or
set environment variables. To do this, choose <i>Execution|Arguments</i>
and specify your options in the <a href="argspwdenv.html">Program Arguments</a>
dialog (before you start the program).
<p>You can also attach to a program that is currently running. To do this,
first load the executable file like above. Then choose <i>Execution|Attach</i>.
Specify the process number and click <i>OK</i>. The running program is
halted (not terminated), and the current point of execution is displayed
in the source window.
<h4>
The program stopped - now what?</h4>
When the program stops at a breakpoint, watchpoint, or due to a signal,
the <a href="sourcecode.html">source code window</a> displays the line
where the program stopped. It is very common that the program stops due
to a signal (usually a <tt>SIGSEGV</tt>, segmentation violation) in a function
that is not part of the program, that you have written. In this case you
investigate the <a href="stack.html">stack window</a> and look for a function
that you have written (start at the top of the list) and click on it. This
will bring you to a location that you can start your search for the real
bug.
<p>In the menu <i>Execution</i> you find the commands that you need to
run
the program, step through code, and to interrupt the program (<i>Break</i>)
while it is running. The important commands (<i>Run</i> and all kinds of
<i>Step</i>) are bound to function keys. For efficient debugging it is
strongly recommend that you get used to using them.
<br><font size=-1>The functions are not configurable, but perhaps you want
to contribute a bit of code that does it?</font>
<p>In the menu <i>Breakpoint</i> you find commands to set, clear, disable,
and enable permanent and temporary breakpoints. You can display a list
of breakpoints in the <a href="breakptlist.html">breakpoints window</a>.
You can also set a breakpoint by clicking at the left end of the source
line (using the left mouse button), and you can enable and disable a breakpoint
by clicking it using the middle mouse button.
<p>The gearwheel in the toolbar indicates whether gdb is working, in which
case it rotates. It rotates fast while KDbg wouldn't accept execution commands,
and it rotates slowly while KDbg retrieves the values of variable.
<h2>
<a NAME="InfoWindows"></a>KDbg's information windows</h2>
KDbg displays information and accepts commands in number of different windows.
In the menu <i>View</i> you find commands to show and hide these windows.
They are docking windows, which means that you can drag them around and
arrange them in any manner you like.

<h2>
<a NAME="KnownProblems"></a>Known problems</h2>
gdb 4.16 has problems in handling C++ classes with virtual base classes.
(Such classes commonly occur in CORBA programs.) It dies quite often due
to a segmentation violation. KDbg reports when gdb exits unexpectedly.
Unfortunately, you cannot really do anything about it. You have to restart
gdb by choosing <i>File|Executable</i>, which restarts your debugging session
:-(.
<p>KDbg's type recognition only works for libraries that are linked dynamically
to the program being debugged.
