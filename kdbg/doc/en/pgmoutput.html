<h1>
The Program Output Window</h1>
The program output window is displayed using <i>View|Output</i>. The output
window captures text that is written to stdout and stderr by the program
being debugged.
<p>The output window does not allow to type input for the program and it
features only minimal terminal emulation: <tt>\n</tt> (line-feed) is treated
like a carriage-return-line-feed combination, and <tt>\r</tt> (carriage-return)
is ignored. These capabilities are usually sufficient to debug GUI programs
which only write debugging output to stdout and stderr.
<p>When a program is debugged with KDbg for the first time, the program
output window is <i>not</i> used. The reason for this is that KDbg cannot
know whether the program requires sophisticated terminal emulation or if
it expects input through a terminal. So, a terminal emulator program is
used by default. In order to redirect the output to the output window,
you must do the following:
<ol>
<li>
Open the <a href="pgmsettings.html">Settings dialog</a> by selecting <i>File|Settings</i>.</li>

<li>
Switch to the <i>Output</i> tab.</li>

<li>
Choose <i>Only output, simple terminal emulation</i> and click <i>OK</i>.</li>

<li>
Reload the program by selecting it from the list in <i>File|Recent Executables</i>.</li>
</ol>
You can clear the contents of the output window by selecting <i>Clear</i>
from the popup menu that appears when you click the right mouse button.
<p>If the last line of the output is visible, the window always scrolls
automatically so that the last line remains visible when new output arrives..
If, however, you manually scroll up so that the last line is not visible,
the visible portion of text will not change.
