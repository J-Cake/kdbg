<h1>
The Source Code Window</h1>
The source code window is the main window and is always visible.
<p>The source code window displays program source code. At the left of
each source line is an "active area". It displays a pointer to indicate
which source line the program currently executes, and it indicates on which
source lines breakpoints have been set.
<p>New breakpoints can be set by clicking into the active area with the
left mouse button. An existing breakpoint can be enabled and disabled by
clicking with the middle mouse button.
<p>The tiny plus '+' between the "active area" and the source line can
be clicked on. If you do so, the source line's assembler code will be displayed.
The plus turns into a minus '-', which, if clicked, will hide the disassembled
code.
<p>Mostly, source code windows are opened automatically. To open a new
source file manually, click the right mouse button and choose <i>Open Source</i>
or choose <i>File|Open Source</i>.
<p>To switch between different source files, choose the source file from
the <i>Window</i> menu.
