Tips and Tricks</h1>

<ul>
<li>
Always set the environment variable <tt>LD_BIND_NOW=1</tt> on glibc2 systems.

<a href="argspwdenv.html#Environment">See here</a> how to set environment
variables.</li>

<li>
You can use breakpoints as bookmarks: Just set a breakpoint and disable
it. Later, you can quickly come back to that breakpoint by double-clicking
it in the breakpoint list (or select it and click <i>View Code</i>). Since
breakpoints are persistent (i.e. KDbg remembers them across invocations
of a program), you get them back next time you invoke KDbg for that particular
program.</li>

<li>
You can change a program variable's value: In the variable watch section
(in the lower right) type an assignment like this: <tt>var.member=17</tt>
and click <i>Add</i>. This immediately changes the value of the variable.
You should delete the expression from the list right away (by selecting
it in the window below and clicking <i>Del</i>). This is because the watch
expressions are evaluate each time the program stops, and by this the variable
would be changed to the specified value again and again!</li>

<li>
You can display a value in the watch section in different ways by prepending
gdb's format specifiers in front of the variable to display. E.g. <tt>/x
var.member</tt> displays the <tt>var.member</tt> in hexadecimal notation.</li>
</ul>
