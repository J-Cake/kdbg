<h1>KDbg's type table</h1>

<p>
KDbg's type tables are located under
<code>$KDEDIR/share/apps/kdbg/types</code>. By convention, there is one
table for each library like Qt, kdecore, X11, etc.
The files are named after the library file and end with
<code>.kdbgtt</code>. Example: The type table for <code>libqt.a</code> is
named <code>qt.kdbgtt</code>.
</p>

<p>
A type table file obeys the regular KDE configuration file syntax. The file
has the following groups:
<il>
<li> A group <code>[Type Table]</code> which lists the types and information
how the debugger can identify whether the program is linked against the
library.
<li> A group for each type which has information about how the value of such
a type is displayed by KDbg.
</il></p>

<h2>The <code>[Type Table]</code> group</h2>

<p>
This group contains the following entries:
<il>
<li> <code>Types1</code>, <code>Types2</code>, etc. These entries name the
types. Each of them is a comma-separated list of type names. Each of the
entries can name any number of types. (The types names can be distributed to
several lines just so that the lines don't get excessivly long.) No blank
space is allowed in these lines. The entries must be numbered consecutively
(KDbg stops reading at the first gap), although an entry may be empty (i.e.
name no type at all). Sometimes the order in which the names are listed is
important (see <code>Alias</code> types below).
<li> One of the following:<br>
<code>IdentifyingType</code> or<br>
<code>IdentifyingVariable</code> or<br>
<code>IdentifyingPrint</code> and <code>IndentifyingPrintResult</code><br>
These entries tell KDbg how it can determine whether the program is linked
against library (to which this type table applies).
<code>IdentifyingType</code> names a sufficiently unique type.
<code>IdentifyingVariable</code> names a (global) variable of the library.
<code>IdentifyingPrint</code> is a print statement (e.g. a variable that
contains a version number) and <code>IdentifyingPrintResult</code> is a
regular expression that must match the print statement's result.<br>
<emph>Currently this information is not used. KDbg just assumes that the
program is linked against this library - in effect, all type tables
available are applied for every program. This usually doesn't hurt.</emph>
</il>
</il></p>

<h2>The type's group</h2>

<p>
There is one group for each type that is named exactly as the type. <emph>At
the moment C++ template classes are not supported.</emph> Each group
contains the following entries:
<il>
<li><code>Display</code> determines how the value of the type is displayed
by KDbg. The string must contain 1 to 5 percent characters '<code>%</code>'.
These are replaced by the results of the expressions printed by the
<code>Expr</code><emph>x</emph> entries.
<li>One or more of <code>Expr1</code>, <code>Expr2</code>, etc. These
entries specify partial expressions that will be submitted to gdb, and the
result substituted back for the corresponding percent character in the
<code>Display</code> string. The partial expression must contain
<strong>exactly one</strong> <code>%s</code> sequence. It will be replaced
by the variable name before the expression is submitted to gdb.
<li><code>Alias</code> names an alias type. If this entry is present, the
type is treated like the named type. That alias type must appear before this
type in the <code>Types</code><emph>x</emph> entries in the <code>Type
Table</code>.
</il>
<p>
<emph>Currently the number of expressions per type is limited to&nbsp;5.
This can easily be changed if it's too restrictive, but I recommend not to
go to that limit at all - it will slow down the debugging process.</emph>
</p>

<h2>An example</h2>
The example shows how <code>QString</code> and <code>QWidget</code> are
defined in <code>qt.kdbgtt</code>. Additionally, <code>QTableView</code> is
defined as an alias of <code>QWidget</code>.
<pre>[Type Table]
Types1=QString
Types2=QWidget,QTableView
[QString]
Display={ % }
Expr1=(%s).shd->data
[QWidget]
Display={ name=% #chld=% #conn=% }
Expr1=(%s).objname
Expr2=(%s).childObjects->numNodes
Expr3=(%s).connections->numItems
[QTableView]
Alias=QWidget
</pre>
Note that it is safer to wrap the <code>%s</code> in parentheses.
